If doing HyperCube-Sphere, can we simplify the intersection by using our
knowledge of which 'dimension' was split. Perhaps always test the most changed
bounding planes along all three prime dimension? Some useless tests will be
performed, but it scales well with dataparallel architectures. (SIMD, GPUs)

Use sphere-cones instead and advance their origin by minT along their
direction. This will also require updating their radius! May be slightly slower,
but ordinary cones can't handle 2 parallel rays.

Add DacrtByDistance again. Only do it at the root and leafs?

Test data! Exhaustive intersections and partitionings(rays and spheres)

Test different termination criterias

Add packets.

Try an (implicit) ray-hierarchy?
