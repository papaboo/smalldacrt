Try HyperCube-Sphere intersection instead of using cones. (Cones may be fast,
but the initial split down the middle of a scene of evenly distributed spheres
only removes ~5%)

If doing HyperCube-Sphere, can we simplify the intersection by using our
knowledge of which 'dimension' was split.

Use sphere-cones instead and advance their origin by minT along their direction

Add DacrtByDistance again. Only do it at the root and leafs?

Test data! Exhaustive intersections and partitionings(rays and spheres)

Add packets.

Try an (implicit) ray-hierarchy?

Test different termination criterias
